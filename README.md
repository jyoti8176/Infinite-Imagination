A Journey into Generative AI

The digital age has revolutionized image creation and manipulation. However, restoring damaged photos, enhancing facial features, or breathing life into black and white images can be time-consuming and require specialized skills. Additionally, generating entirely new visuals or modifying existing ones often necessitates artistic expertise.

This project delves into the transformative realm of generative AI, aiming to harness its potential for image enhancement and creative generation.
It explores the advanced capabilities of generative AI in image enhancement and creation. The project employs state-of-the-art techniques to transform visual media. 

It encompasses two key functionalities: Image Enhancer and Generative AI. The Image Enhancer tackles various photo restoration tasks and focuses on improving the quality and aesthetics of existing images. It can remove scratches using pre-trained models, enhance facial features with advanced techniques like RealESRGAN and GFPGAN, and bring life to black and white photos through colorization using machine learning libraries. Additionally, it offers tools to improve low-light images and remove unwanted backgrounds using segmentation models. 

The Generative AI section empowers users to unleash their creativity. It allows generating entirely new images based on textual descriptions through the power of stable diffusion AI models. Furthermore, it provides functionalities to replace objects within images seamlessly and modify backgrounds of specific elements using segmentation and inpainting techniques. Users can even remove unwanted objects altogether, combining the capabilities of segmentation models with LAMA (Large Adaptive Multi-Modal Transformer) for a comprehensive solution.
